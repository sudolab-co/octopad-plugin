# Compact artifact shapes

Use these as adaptable shapes, not forms that must be filled. Omit irrelevant sections. Preserve the product's existing vocabulary and page conventions.

## Product Map

```markdown
# Product Map

## Product foundation
- Purpose: <confirmed statement or Unknown>
- Intended users: <confirmed statement or Unknown>
- Current evidence: <source and last verified time>

## Systems
| System | Responsibility | State | Product Spec | Active work |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Architecture
- Canonical Architecture Map: <Octopad page, repository link when the team keeps it beside the code, or Not established>

## Ideas
- Ideas page: <link, only when one exists>

## Cross-system relationships
- <only important relationships>

## Gaps and stale areas
- <explicit gap, evidence needed, and related documentation-debt work>
```

## Product Spec

```markdown
# <System name> — Product Spec

## Purpose and boundary
<User need, responsibility, and what is outside the system.>

## Released behavior
<Current production truth only.>

## Changes by evidence state
<Give each item its own idea, explored, accepted, implemented, or merged state and link it to its Decision or work.>

## Rules and edge cases
<Only behavior people must understand. Link a Behavioral Contract when needed.>

## Parked ideas
- <date parked>: <idea>, <the problem it addresses>.

## Connections
- Product Map: <link>
- Architecture Map: <link or relevant section>
- Decisions: <links>
- Work stream and Tasks: <links>
- User documentation: <links>

## Verification
- Evidence: <source>
- Source revision or release: <exact value or Unknown>
- Last verified: <time or Unknown>
- Freshness: <current | stale | unverified>
- Known gaps: <gaps or None found>
```

Do not mix unreleased behavior into the released section. Put lifecycle state on each material claim or change, not on the Product Spec as a whole. A Product Spec may contain items in several states when they remain visibly separated.

Keep every parked idea to that one line. Omit the section until the system has a parked idea, and drop the section again once the last line leaves it.

## Ideas

Create this page only when an idea concerns no existing system yet. Keep one per product documentation set and link it from the Product Map.

```markdown
# Ideas

Ideas with no system yet. One line each.

- <date parked>: <idea>, <the problem it addresses>.
```

Carry no owner, priority, status, or other Task field here. Move a line into a system's Product Spec once that system exists. Remove a line the user rejects; any useful rejection reason belongs in history, never in `Parked ideas`.

## Behavioral Contract

```markdown
# <Behavior> — Behavioral Contract

## Scope
<Boundary and actors.>

## Inputs and preconditions
<Exact conditions.>

## Outputs and effects
<Observable behavior.>

## Invariants and failure behavior
<Rules, edge cases, and failure semantics.>

## Compatibility or migration
<Only when applicable.>

## Enforcement and evidence
- Tests, types, schemas, lint, or CI: <links>
- Source revision or release: <exact value>
- Last verified: <time>
```

## Architecture Map

```markdown
# Architecture Map

## Components and boundaries
<Major runtime or deployable components only.>

## Data and external services
<Stable stores, flows, and external dependencies.>

## Canonical code and enforcement
<Repository locations and executable contracts, without a file inventory.>

## Release model
<How released state is actually established.>

## Related product systems
<Links to Product Specs and targeted Engineering References.>

## Verification
- Source revision: <exact value>
- Last verified: <time>
- Gaps: <explicit unknowns>
```

## Documentation-debt Task

Keep one bounded Task for related gaps. Give its description literal `Why`, `What`, and `Done when` sections. Provide `impact` from 1 to 5 and `impact_rationale`. For a subtask, use `parent_task_id`; for every dependency edge, include its rationale. State why the missing or stale knowledge matters, what evidence or repair is needed, and what proves completion. Link the affected pages, repository locations, PRs, releases, and Decisions. Do not copy the Task's status into those pages.
